# Google App Engine

> The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage use the Google App Engine default bucket, which means that if you build an App Engine app, you can use the built in App Engine APIs to share data between Firebase and App Engine. This is useful for performing audio encoding, video transcoding, and image transformations, as well as other computation intensive background processing.
