# STT + Google App Engine

Since running google STT inside a cloud function times out, a better solution \(TBC?\) could be of using a cloud function to trigger a google app engine job, and then have it save the result to firestore. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
see [STT + cloud function + cloud task](stt-+-cloud-function-+-cloud-task/) instead
{% endhint %}
