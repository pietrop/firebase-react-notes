# Node & nvm

## Getting started

First we need to install some tools. These instruction assume a unix terminal prompt. For windows, install WSL \(Windows Subsystem for Linux\) from the Windows app store

## Install NodeJS

If you already have NodeJS installed, you can skip ahead. If not head on over to nodejs.org and download an installer or use nvm to be able to future-proof your NodeJS installation.

Using nvm:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal or follow the instructions on the terminal. Then install node:

```bash
nvm install 12
```
