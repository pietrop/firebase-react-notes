# Firebase React Notes

Some notes on using firebase with react. linking to original sources and docs.

Firebase docs are pretty good, but sometimes for specific use cases and implementations you need to combine a mix of docs, blog posts, firecast videos and stack Overflow. 

The idea is, eg if you start a new project tomorrow having a go to place that brings together links, code snippets and insight. In an easy to find format. 

Also useful if you onboard someone new to a project, who might have limited or no firebase experience, to get them up to speed more efficiently on specific things.
