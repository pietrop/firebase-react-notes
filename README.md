# Firebase React notes



Firebase docs are pretty good, but sometimes for specific use cases you need to combine a mix of docs, blog posts, firecast videos and stackoverlow. 

The idea is, eg if you start a new project tomorrow having a go to place that has got all the links and insight. in an easy to find format.   
  
Some notes on using firebase with react. linking to original sources and docs.

Also useful if you onboard someone new to you project with limited or no firebase experience, to get them up to speed more efficiently.
